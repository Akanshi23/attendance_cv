## Face Recognition System
Welcome to the Face Recognition System! This project implements a robust and efficient face recognition system using machine learning techniques. It can identify and verify faces in images or video streams.

## Features
- Detect faces in images and video streams
- Recognize faces against a pre-existing database
- Real-time face recognition capabilities
- Easy integration with various applications

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- NumPy
- Flask (for web interface, optional)

You can install the required packages using pip:
`pip install opencv-python dlib numpy flask`

## Installation
Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Akanshi23/attendance_cv.git'
cd attendance_cv
Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
